Ambiguity vs redundancy

Violation of quantity maxim-- why, if it doesn't add information?
1. redundancy in agreement -> reinforcement of noun class on other categories
2. why is it common crosslinguistically, if it adds complexity?
3. Is it functional for learning to have redundancy in case marking?
4. For children, harder to repeat what you were exposed to when there's redundancy... but easier to produce on novel nouns. No change for adults
5. Child directed speech more redundant? orange carrot vs carrot
6. Cute little puppies-- makes the prediction for the next word easier even if it doesn't restrain puppies that much
7. Noisy channel model (ie Shannon entropy)- how do rational speakers minimize information loss while maximizing channel capacity 
8. Where can you use that? Sometimes it's not required, might be helpful to include or remove depending on what rate of information is desirable
9. Complexity vs givenness
	1. Degrees of givenness
10. War is war -> the tautology isn't informative, so you have to find out why they said it
11. Violations of quantity -> search for a reason why
